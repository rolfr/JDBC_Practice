<h2>Practice SQL access via JDBC</h2>
<p>This is a fun little project I've started for the purpose of getting back into Java, particularly working with SQL access.</p>
<p>I've so far set up a personal MySQL server at home and an Azure SQL server, and the master branch is running against MySQL.  I have a private branch 
that is converted to use Azure SQL, but I'd rather pick a good design pattern for allowing a clean switch between the two at runtime.
So that's the next thing I'll be checking in.</p>
